This Project had us Use Javascript/Jquery, css, Html Moment(),

I added the date to the Jumbotron.

I also added a working clock for fun.

It required us to create various rows and columns in order to create a description, event and lock/save containers for hours between 9am and 5pm.

First you write an event.
Then click on the save/lock.  
The event is then saved in localStorage so that when you refresh or restart the pge the events will re-propogate.

This was a very challenging poject, and it caused me to go deeper of my learning with targeting and saving eventclicked data.
